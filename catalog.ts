// The demo's storefront catalog — now CONSUMING the extracted package
// (@openmobilehub/attesto-storefront) for the pricing/order model instead of
// duplicating it. This file is the demo's catalog DATA (its products + reviews)
// plus thin catalog-bound wrappers; the cart → priced-cart → order logic lives in
// the package and is injected with the demo's own `CATALOG`, so the storefront
// logic exists in exactly one place and can't drift between the demo and the
// package (US2 / 002 — "the demo consumes the package").
//
// The `checkout` MCP tool, the checkout web page, and the caBLE payment ceremony
// still live in the demo (server.ts / checkout.ts / app.ts / payment-gate/);
// rewiring those onto createStorefront() + attesto.mount() is the steered finish
// (feature 003). Reviews stay local: the demo's review shape ({title, body})
// differs from the package's ({text}), and is data, not logic.
