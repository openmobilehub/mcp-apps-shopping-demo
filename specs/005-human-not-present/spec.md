# Feature Specification: Human-Not-Present (HNP) Delegation — First Increment

**Feature Branch**: `005-human-not-present` (continues the 001–004 line; based off `feat/attesto-gate-v0.1`,
not `main` — do not lose prior work)

**Created**: 2026-06-29

**Status**: Draft — **decisions baked in from research + hardened by an adversarial review; awaiting maintainer
confirmation** (see callouts)

**Input**: A typed **`ap2.IntentMandate`** that lets an agent complete a consequential **action** when the
human is **not present**, under a **bounded, revocable, auditable** grant — the **smallest honest end-to-end
slice**. HNP is the v0.2 user/agent-signed mandate line that 004 (`specs/004-cart-mandate/spec.md`) explicitly
deferred. Grounding: `docs/superpowers/research/2026-06-29-human-not-present-scoping.md` (5-dimension research +
a 13-item decision menu).

## Overview

Attesto today runs one model: **human-present (HP)**. At the moment a consequential action completes, a live
human performs a fresh ceremony (WebAuthn passkey / OpenID4VP) bound to this origin with nonce/replay
protection. This feature adds the deferred counterpart: **human-not-present (HNP)** — the agent completes an
**action** *later*, with no live human, by presenting a **server-issued, bounded, revocable grant**.

The increment is deliberately the **smallest honest end-to-end slice**:

- **Delegate (human present, once):** the user performs one live ceremony (reusing an existing rail to
  authenticate). The **server** treats that as delegation and seals **server-composed** bounds into a typed
  **`ap2.IntentMandate`** — server-HMAC via `signingKey` — carrying an (informational) subject, a
  **single-origin** payee + product/category **scope allowlist**, a **per-action cap** (amount + currency,
  absolute ceiling), a **time window**, `singleUse: true`, `presence: "delegated-demo"`,
  `trust_level: "server-issued-demo"`, and an explicit `disclaimer`.
- **Redeem (human NOT present):** the agent calls a redeem path with a proposed cart; the system verifies the
  grant (signature → window → not-revoked → not-consumed), **re-prices from the catalog** (ignoring
  membership/loyalty discounts — those are non-delegable), asserts the order is **within scope**, applies the
  **step-up** check, asserts the re-priced total **≤ the cap**, derives the payment amount from the re-priced
  total, and routes through `completeOrder` — which **re-checks every control at the seam** (fail-closed), writes
  a `delegationId`, and **suppresses real settlement** for the demo-fenced grant.

It is **additive and fail-closed**, reuses primitives that already exist (the HMAC `signingKey`, the per-order
`VerificationStore`, the shared `completeOrder`), and upholds invariants 1–5 (invariant 6 only **partially** —
see below). It **names** all three AP2 mandate types (Intent → Cart → Payment) at the shape level for the GDC /
Multipaz narrative — **none is user-signed in v0.1**.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 — Pre-authorize once; the agent completes an in-bounds order while I'm away (Priority: P1)

A user performs one live ceremony to delegate bounded authority; the server issues a grant for a product set,
up to a cap, before an expiry. Later, with the user **not present**, the agent assembles a cart inside those
bounds and the order **completes** — re-priced from the catalog, recorded with a link back to the grant.

**Why this priority**: It is the entire point — an agent acting unattended within server-issued bounds. It is
the MVP slice and a complete GDC demo on its own.

**Independent Test**: Mint an Intent Mandate via the delegate flow under a live ceremony; with no live ceremony,
submit a proposed cart that is in-scope, under the cap, and inside the window; assert the order completes through
`completeOrder`, the completion record carries the grant's `delegationId`, the charged amount equals the catalog
re-priced total, and **no settlement is invoked**.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid, unexpired, not-revoked single-use grant scoped to product set P with per-action cap C,
   **When** the agent redeems it (no live human) with a cart ⊆ P whose re-priced total ≤ C, **Then** the order
   completes via `completeOrder`, the record links `delegationId`, the grant is **atomically** marked consumed,
   and `ctx.settle` is not called.
2. **Given** the grant just consumed by scenario 1, **When** the agent redeems it again, **Then** it is refused
   (single-use already consumed) and nothing is recorded.
3. **Given** an in-bounds cart whose catalog price drifted upward since delegation but still **≤ C**, **When**
   redeemed, **Then** it completes at the **re-priced** total (never a price carried in the grant) and the bound
   payment amount equals that re-priced total.

### User Story 2 — Out-of-bounds draws are refused (the bounds are load-bearing controls) (Priority: P1)

Any redemption outside the grant's bounds is refused server-side, **on every completion path** (including direct
`completeOrder` / place-order / MCP-tool calls), recording nothing — with a reason distinct enough to tell
tamper from expiry from over-cap.

**Why this priority**: The bounds are the only thing between "server-issued grant" and "blank cheque." Each must
be a real control (a test that still passes with the control removed is not a useful test).

**Independent Test**: For each bound, craft a redemption that violates exactly that bound — **submitting it
directly to `completeOrder`/place-order/the MCP tool, not only the intent rail** — and assert it is refused with
the expected reason, records nothing; then assert the otherwise-identical in-bounds redemption completes. Remove
the seam control and assert the bypass test fails.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a grant with per-action cap C, **When** a cart re-prices **above C**, **Then** it is refused
   (over-cap) and nothing is recorded.
2. **Given** a grant scoped to product set P, **When** a cart contains an item ∉ P (or a different payee/origin),
   **Then** it is refused (out-of-scope).
3. **Given** an expired grant, **When** redeemed, **Then** it is refused (expired), with a reason distinct from a
   tamper failure.
4. **Given** a grant whose HMAC payload was edited in transit, **When** redeemed, **Then** it is refused
   (signature).
5. **Given** an **age-restricted** cart, **When** redeemed unattended (regardless of any snapshot), **Then** it
   is **always refused with a step-up signal** — age can never complete from a grant; it requires a live
   ceremony ("delegate actions, not identity").
6. **Given** a single-use grant already consumed, **When** a second draw is attempted, **Then** it is refused
   (consumed) and nothing is recorded.
7. **Given** a cart above the **step-up threshold** (amount > step-up limit, age-restricted goods, or an
   off-allowlist payee), **When** redeemed unattended, **Then** it is refused and the response indicates a live
   ceremony is required.
8. **Given** a passing gate but a **revoked / consumed / out-of-bounds** grant submitted **directly to
   `completeOrder`** (bypassing the rail), **When** processed, **Then** the seam refuses fail-closed and records
   nothing (no upstream-only enforcement).

### User Story 3 — Revoke a grant and it stops working immediately (Priority: P2)

The user can revoke a standing grant (or kill all grants for a subject), and the very next redemption is refused
— fail-closed even if the revocation store is unreachable, and even if revocation lands **between** rail-verify
and `completeOrder` (TOCTOU). A "active grants" view lists outstanding grants and is the audit trail.

**Why this priority**: The moment a standing capability exists the user must be able to kill it. Revocation is
non-negotiable; the audit trail replaces the human-in-the-loop moment.

**Independent Test**: Revoke a valid grant, then attempt a previously-in-bounds redemption and assert refusal
(revoked), nothing recorded; make the revocation store unreachable and assert redemption **fails closed**; revoke
**after** rail-verify but before `completeOrder` and assert the seam still refuses; list active grants and assert
the revoked one is absent/marked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid grant, **When** the user revokes it and the agent then redeems it, **Then** it is refused
   (revoked), nothing recorded.
2. **Given** the revocation store is unreachable, **When** any grant is redeemed, **Then** it is refused
   (fail-closed), never allowed by default.
3. **Given** several grants for a subject, **When** the per-subject kill-switch fires, **Then** all of that
   subject's subsequent redemptions are refused.

### User Story 4 — The honesty disclosures are present, positive, and load-bearing (Priority: P2)

Every surface representing an HNP grant carries `presence: "delegated-demo"`, `trust_level: "server-issued-demo"`,
and an explicit `disclaimer` field, and carries **no** `authorizedByUser`/`userSigned` field; no HNP draw settles
real value. These are asserted by tests. (These are **disclosure-label** tests — distinct from the **security
bypass** tests of US2/US3.)

**Why this priority**: Removing the human makes the demo-vs-real gap more dangerous to blur than for the age gate.

**Independent Test**: Assert every exposed surface reports the three honesty fields and **lacks** any
user-authorization field; assert the `completeOrder` HNP branch never calls `ctx.settle` for
`presence: "delegated-demo"` and that removing that guard turns the test red.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a minted grant, **When** inspected via any exposed surface, **Then** it reports
   `presence: "delegated-demo"` + `trust_level: "server-issued-demo"` + a non-empty `disclaimer`, and exposes no
   `authorizedByUser`/`userSigned` field.
2. **Given** an HNP redemption, **When** it completes, **Then** the HNP branch does **not** invoke `ctx.settle`
   (settlement suppression is the control; the test fails if the guard is removed).

### Edge Cases

- **Grant predates the order** — no order id to equality-bind at issuance; binding is a *scope-contains*
  predicate at redeem, never equality.
- **Bearer risk (documented limitation)** — v0.1 has no holder binding / per-draw PoP, so whoever holds the grant
  redeems it within caps; `subject` is informational (kill-switch + audit key), not enforced. A test documents
  that redeem requires no live nonce and a non-subject presenter is accepted in v0.1.
- **Price drift** — the re-priced catalog total, not any amount in the grant, is authoritative; above the cap it
  refuses (or steps up).
- **Revocation store unreachable** — fail closed (refuse), never fail open.
- **Two concurrent redemptions of one single-use grant** — the consume must be an **atomic compare-and-set**
  keyed per grant id (per-order idempotency does not cover this), so exactly one completes.
- **Confused/buggy agent draws in-scope** — HNP cannot prevent a faithful-looking in-bounds draw; it only bounds
  and audits. High-consequence actions are reserved for live presence / step-up.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Define a typed **`ap2.IntentMandate`** carrying at least: `id` (stable per-grant, long-lived),
  `subject` (verified at delegation; **informational in v0.1 — NOT enforced at redeem; kill-switch/audit key**),
  `scope` (single-origin payee + product/category allowlist), `perActionCap` (amount + currency),
  `window` (`notBefore`/`expiresAt`), `singleUse: true`, `alg`, `signature`, `presence: "delegated-demo"`,
  `trust_level: "server-issued-demo"`, and a non-empty `disclaimer` string. It carries **no captured identity
  claim** (no `age_over_21` snapshot — age is non-delegable).
- **FR-002**: Seal the grant with the existing injected **`signingKey`** via a constant-time HMAC. The `alg`
  field is **reserved**: v0.1 fixes it to the HMAC suite; a future user/agent-key-signed variant (ES256 / KB-JWT)
  requires **widening the `alg` union AND adding a verify-dispatch that does not exist today** (this branch has
  only `mandate.ts` with `alg: "MOCK-DEV-SIGNER"`). Do not present `alg` as a working drop-in.
- **FR-003**: Provide a dedicated **delegate** flow that, at the end of **one live ceremony** (reusing an
  existing rail to authenticate), mints the grant and emits a manifest entry with `enforcedAt: "intent"`. The
  `enforcedAt` union MUST be **additively widened** to `"tool" | "checkout" | "intent"` (a type extension across
  the manifest types + resolver; verify no exhaustiveness switch breaks). Delegation is explicit, never a side
  effect of a purchase. **In v0.1 the server composes + signs the bounds**, not the user.
- **FR-004**: Provide a **redeem** path (`redeemIntent(intentId, proposedCart)`) executable with **no live
  human** that, before recording anything, performs in order: signature valid → within window → not revoked →
  **atomically** not-already-consumed → re-price the cart from the catalog (**ignoring membership/loyalty
  discounts**) → order ⊆ `scope` → **step-up check (before cap)** → re-priced total **≤ `perActionCap`**
  (tolerance = 0, absolute ceiling) → derive the payment amount from the re-priced total. Any failure refuses,
  records nothing, returns a reason distinct enough to separate signature / expiry / over-cap / out-of-scope /
  revoked / consumed / step-up. There is **no captured-attribute re-enforcement** (age steps up; membership
  ignored).
- **FR-005**: Enforce a configurable **presence-required step-up threshold** with **step-up limit ≤
  `perActionCap`** and **deterministic precedence (step-up checked before cap)**: a draw above the step-up limit,
  for age-restricted goods, or for an off-allowlist payee MUST be refused unattended and signal a live ceremony.
  (In v0.1, step-up escalates to another **presence-only-demo** rail — still demo-fenced — reducing unattended
  blast radius, **not** reaching real assurance.)
- **FR-006**: `completeOrder` gains **one additive, fail-closed `intentMandate` branch** (it is **not**
  unchanged): when `input.intentMandate` is present it MUST (a) re-verify the grant signature, (b) re-check
  not-revoked + not-consumed + scope-contains + cap + window **fail-closed**, (c) write `delegationId` onto the
  completed record, and (d) **suppress real settlement** (never call `ctx.settle`) for `presence:
  "delegated-demo"`. The live rails are otherwise untouched. The intent rail's per-order verification write MUST
  either reuse a **shared, exported** `recordVerified` helper (preferred per CLAUDE.md — extract it) or
  explicitly replicate the `ctx.verificationStore.write` pattern.
- **FR-007**: The bounds-check + revocation-check MUST be enforced **server-side on every completion path**
  (place-order, the rail verify handler, AND the MCP tool) — at the **seam** (FR-006), so a producer reaching
  `completeOrder` directly with an `intentMandate` is still fully checked, including a revocation that lands
  **between** rail-verify and `completeOrder` (TOCTOU).
- **FR-008**: The system MUST NOT trust any amount/balance in the grant; **catalog re-derivation is the price
  authority** (invariant 2). The bound payment amount MUST equal the re-priced total **and** be **≤
  `perActionCap`** on every path (invariant 3). **HNP re-pricing ignores membership/loyalty discounts** (full
  catalog price); the intent rail MUST NOT write `loyalty.applied`, and a grant MUST NOT obtain a discount
  without a backing per-order verification record.
- **FR-009**: The single-use **consume** MUST be an **atomic compare-and-set** keyed by the stable grant id,
  performed **transactionally with the record write inside the `completeOrder` branch** (not process-global —
  invariant 4). Name the seam that holds the consumed flag (extend `RevocationStore` to `{ revoked, consumed }`
  per grant, or a dedicated consume store). The in-memory variant is permitted **only** for the single-instance
  local demo behind the existing `allowEphemeralKey`-style fence and is **explicitly not a real control under
  multi-instance deployment** (real deployments require Redis/Upstash `SETNX`/Lua). Rationale: `completeOrder`
  idempotency is keyed by **order id**, so two concurrent redemptions producing two order ids would both pass
  without the per-grant atomic consume.
- **FR-010**: Introduce a new injected **`RevocationStore`** seam checked **fail-closed** on every redemption
  (store unreachable ⇒ refuse), exposing revoke + a **per-subject kill-switch** + a **"active grants"** listing.
  Wiring is **real glue, not zero-glue**: add it to `CeremonySeams` + `CeremonyContext` + the `mount()` resolver
  (and its fail-fast list) where the rail consults it, and to `CompletionContext` where the seam consults it, and
  budget the `app.locals.attesto` change in every composing host.
- **FR-011**: The completed-order record MUST carry a **`delegationId`** (a type change) linking every unattended
  completion back to its authorizing grant (the audit trail).
- **FR-012**: Add a new **orthogonal `presence` axis** (`"live" | "delegated-demo" | "delegated"`) carrying only
  *when consent happened*. Do **NOT** reuse `trust_level: "presence-only-demo"` for HNP: add a new weaker
  authorization-integrity value **`server-issued-demo`** (the issuance-vs-authorization rung), and v0.1 HNP MUST
  carry `presence: "delegated-demo"` + `trust_level: "server-issued-demo"`. This **amends** the `trust_level`
  docstring (strip the live-ceremony/nonce connotation, which now lives on the presence axis) and **Principle
  VII** (governance dependency). A *real* HNP control = `presence: "delegated"` AND `trust_level:
  "issuer-verified"`.
- **FR-013**: Delegation MUST be limited to **action effects** (`authorize` / custom action gates). Attribute
  gates (age, membership) MUST NOT be delegable: **age-restricted goods always step up** to a live ceremony and
  never complete unattended; membership discounts are ignored under HNP. There is no captured-identity
  re-enforcement.
- **FR-014**: Honesty MUST be expressed as **machine-checkable positives**: every HNP surface carries a mandatory
  `disclaimer` (e.g. *"server-issued; not user authorization; demo only — not a safety control"*) and carries
  **no** `authorizedByUser`/`userSigned` field; tests assert the disclaimer is present and the authorization
  field is absent on every enumerated surface. No HNP draw settles real value (the FR-006 suppression is the
  control). These are **disclosure-label** assertions, kept distinct from the **security bypass** tests.
- **FR-015**: The pre-existing suite MUST stay green, and **every security bypass test MUST fail with its control
  removed** (constitution; 003 FR-014; 004 FR-009). DCO sign-off on every commit.

### Key Entities

- **IntentMandate** — `type: "ap2.IntentMandate"`; the server-issued, single-use, bounded grant. Names the
  top-of-chain AP2 type (shape only; server-HMAC, not user-signed in v0.1).
- **Presence axis** — `live | delegated-demo | delegated`; *when* consent happened. Separate from `trust_level`
  (*how strongly* the authorization/credential is bound), which gains `server-issued-demo`.
- **RevocationStore** (extended to hold the per-grant **consumed** flag) — fail-closed per-grant state behind the
  active-grants surface + kill-switch; wired through the ceremony + completion seams.
- **Intent rail** — a new `ceremony/intent/` rail that verifies a grant (first pass) and projects into
  `completeOrder`, whose **additive `intentMandate` branch** re-checks every control at the seam.
- **CompletedRecord.delegationId** — the audit link from an unattended completion to its grant.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A user pre-authorizes once (one live ceremony) and the agent then completes an in-bounds order
  **with no human present**, end-to-end on the single-server demo, with `delegationId` recorded and **no
  settlement** invoked (US1).
- **SC-002**: **100%** of the defined bypass conditions are refused with nothing recorded **when submitted
  directly to `completeOrder`/place-order/the MCP tool**, each control-dependent: over-cap, out-of-scope,
  expired, tampered-HMAC, consumed/replay, revoked, age-restricted (step-up), and over-step-up-threshold (US2).
  Removing any seam control turns its bypass test red.
- **SC-003**: A revoked grant (or per-subject kill-switch) refuses the **next** redemption; an unreachable
  revocation store refuses **fail-closed**; a revocation landing between rail-verify and `completeOrder` still
  refuses (US3).
- **SC-004**: The bound payment amount equals the catalog re-priced total **and ≤ `perActionCap`** on the HNP
  path (invariants 2 + 3); HNP applies no membership discount; no surface trusts an amount carried in the grant.
- **SC-005**: Two simultaneous redemptions of one single-use grant yield **exactly one** completion (atomic
  consume) (US1.2 + concurrency).
- **SC-006**: Every HNP surface reports `presence: "delegated-demo"` + `trust_level: "server-issued-demo"` + a
  non-empty `disclaimer`, exposes no user-authorization field, and the HNP `completeOrder` branch never invokes
  `ctx.settle` — each assertion control-dependent (US4).
- **SC-007**: `completeOrder` gains only the additive `intentMandate` branch + `delegationId`; the live rails are
  otherwise untouched and the full pre-existing suite stays green.

## Assumptions

- The stable injected `signingKey` seam (already required on serverless for the challenge token and the 004 cart
  mandate) is available wherever Intent Mandates are minted/verified (verified: `mount.ts`).
- A single-server, single-origin demo (this server's payee) suffices to demonstrate HNP end-to-end; no issuer,
  merchant discovery, or A2A fan-out is required.
- The injected `RevocationStore`/consume store defaults to in-memory for the local single-instance demo (behind
  the explicit ephemeral fence) and Redis/Upstash (atomic CAS) for any real deployment.

## Out of Scope (v0.2+)

- **Holder binding + per-draw proof-of-possession** (the grant is a bearer token in v0.1) — the v0.2/v0.3 line
  where invariant 6 becomes fully upheld.
- **User/agent-key signing** (ES256 / KB-JWT, widening `alg` + a verify-dispatch) — the v0.2 bridge;
  **issuer-verified credentials** — the v0.3 destination where an HNP grant becomes a *real* control.
- **Reusable spending envelopes** + **cumulative / velocity caps** + the **atomic per-grant ledger** — the next
  increment; a cumulative cap is only a real control with atomic compare-and-set.
- **Attribute-gate delegation** (age / membership) and any **captured-claim staleness** machinery — excluded by
  design (v0.1 has no credential-validity anchor; age steps up).
- **`presence` on `PaymentMandate`/other surfaces** — a broad cross-cutting type change; non-normative note only,
  out of this increment's test/SC obligations.
- **Full async step-up mode**, **multi-merchant / A2A fan-out**, **sub-delegation**, and **real settlement** of
  any HNP draw.

## Dependencies

- Builds on **004** (`ap2.CartMandate`, the reconciliation with `ap2.PaymentMandate`) and **003** (the mounted
  rails + the shared `completeOrder` + the per-order `VerificationStore`).
- **Governance (Decision 13) — flag for the maintainer:** depends on a **MINOR amendment** to the constitution
  covering **Principle II** (Context 1 performs no ceremony but *verifies a pre-existing delegation created in an
  earlier, separate ceremony*), **Principle III** (Consolidated checkout — HNP redeem has **no browser session**;
  reconcile), and **Principle VII** (the new `presence` axis, the `server-issued-demo` value, and
  `enforcedAt: "intent"`). It also disambiguates "verification_required envelope" vs "spending envelope" and
  decides the Mode-B `gated()` primitive's fate (decoupled from this increment; async step-up is out of scope).
  The amendment is a separate `/speckit-constitution` step, not performed by this spec.

## Constitution Check

- **Principle VII (Honesty in the types) — AMENDED, not merely satisfied:** v0.1 HNP gets its own `presence:
  "delegated-demo"` + `trust_level: "server-issued-demo"` (never reusing `presence-only-demo`), an explicit
  `disclaimer`, and is fenced harder than the live rails. The type/docstring edits + the presence axis are
  **in-scope work**, governed by the Decision-13 amendment.
- **Security Requirements (the six controls):** invariants **1–5 upheld** (FR-004/006/007/008/009/013/014).
  **Invariant 6 only PARTIALLY**: origin-bound + single-use, but **no holder binding and no per-draw PoP** — the
  grant is a bearer token (disclosed in FR-001/edge cases; holder-binding/PoP is v0.2/v0.3). Note: re-enforcing a
  captured snapshot would be *weaker* than invariant 5's contemporaneous positive claim — which is exactly why
  attribute delegation is excluded and age always steps up.
- **Principle II (three execution contexts) — REQUIRES amendment:** Context 1 now *verifies a pre-existing
  delegation* rather than *performs no credential ceremony*. **Principle III (Consolidated checkout) — strained:**
  HNP redeem has no single browser session. Both are recorded as the Decision-13 dependency, resolved before
  `/speckit-implement`.
