# Specification Quality Checklist: Gate Ceremony Extraction (attesto.mount)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All five maintainer decisions are encoded; **no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**. FR-010 (injected store
  seam) is explicitly flagged as the one item to sanity-check at `/speckit-plan` — it is *decided*, not open.
- **Protocol naming is intentional.** This is an *extraction* of an existing, protocol-defined ceremony, so the
  spec names the standards it moves (WebAuthn, OpenID4VP/mdoc, AP2 mandate, x402/Hedera settlement) as **domain
  entities**, not as implementation choices — the same precedent as the 002 storefront spec. The spec deliberately
  does not specify code structure, file layout, or library call shapes; those belong to `/speckit-plan`.
- Trust-level honesty (presence-only, fenced as demo) is a first-class requirement (FR-011, SC-006), per the
  constitution's `trust_level` axis.
