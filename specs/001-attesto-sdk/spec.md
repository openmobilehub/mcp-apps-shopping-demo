# Attesto SDK — v0.1 Spec

**Status:** design, grounded in the working reference server in this repo. Every claim cites real code.
**One line:** an SDK that lets a developer gate a consequential MCP tool behind a verifiable credential
from the user's phone wallet. Identity leads; payments is one application.

> **Read this section first. Every example in this spec — and in the docs — must respect it.**

## §0 · The three execution contexts

A credential is proven on the user's **phone**, so it can never happen inside an MCP tool call. That one
fact splits the system into three contexts that run at different times, in different places. Conflating
them is what made every earlier draft confusing.

```
┌─ CONTEXT 1 · the MCP tool handler (your Node server) — runs ONCE, when checkout is requested ─┐
│  TRIGGER: the user clicks the widget's "Checkout" button  OR  says "check out" in chat.        │
│    src/app.tsx:278  callServerTool({ name: "checkout", arguments: { items } })                 │
│    server.ts        the registered `checkout` handler runs here, server-side                   │
│  JOB: take the cart items → build + price the order → return the checkout link (+ what it      │
│       will require). Then it EXITS. No phone is in the loop yet.                                │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │ returns { orderId, checkoutUrl, requires }
                         ▼
┌─ CONTEXT 2 · the checkout page (browser + phone) — where the gates actually run ──────────────┐
│    src/app.tsx:281  openLink({ url: checkoutUrl })  → opens /checkout?order=ID                 │
│  Separate HTTP routes, NOT the Context-1 handler:                                              │
│    verify age  (/credential-gate/age → OpenID4VP/mdoc on the phone → /verify → back, page.ts:75)│
│    pay         (/payment-gate/passkey or /dc-payment → WebAuthn / wallet-signed AP2 over caBLE) │
│    settle      (completion.ts → re-price + x402→Hedera → orderStore.write)                      │
│  Age is RE-ENFORCED server-side on every completion path → 403 (passkey/routes.ts:67,          │
│  dc-payment/routes.ts:58, app.ts:71). Fail-closed regardless of what Context 1 returned.       │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                         ▼
┌─ CONTEXT 3 · completion (poll) — how the agent learns it finished ────────────────────────────┐
│    src/app.tsx:286  pollOrderCompletion() → GET /checkout/order-status                         │
│  On completion the widget injects a silent chat turn (app.tsx:182) → the agent confirms.       │
│  The agent may also poll the `get-order-status` MCP tool directly (server.ts).                 │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Consequences that every design decision inherits:**

1. The **handler runs once, when checkout is requested** — not during verification or payment. Its only
   job is to mint the link and report what the upcoming page will require. (This is why an SDK call in
   the handler *reports* requirements; it does not *perform* them — there is no phone in Context 1.)
2. The **gates run in Context 2**, on the page/phone, via separate routes.
3. **Fail-closed lives in Context 2's completion paths** (the 403s), independent of Context 1. An
   age-restricted order can never complete unverified even if Context 1 returned a bare link.
4. **One handoff.** The user opens the checkout link once and does age → (loyalty) → payment in that one
   browser session; they return to chat only when Context 3 reports completion.

## §1 · The flow (consolidated checkout)

```
checkout({ items })  ──▶  Context 1: priceCart(items) → order; report requirements
              ◀──  { orderId, checkoutUrl, requires: ["age 21+", "payment"] }
agent → user: "Opening checkout — you'll verify you're 21 and pay on your phone: <checkoutUrl>"
user opens checkoutUrl  ── ONE handoff ──▶  Context 2: verify age → pay → settle (one session)
Context 3: poll → COMPLETED { total, gates, settlement+HashScan }  →  agent confirms in chat
```

This is the demo's actual flow. An earlier draft put age verification at the *tool* as a separate
blocking step, which forced the user back and forth between chat and browser twice — a regression.
Consolidated is the default. (The separate-blocking shape survives only for **Mode B** below.)

## §2 · Where each credential runs

| Credential | Reported in Ctx 1 | Proof ceremony (Ctx 2) | Enforced server-side |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **age** (required) | ✅ in `requires` | `/credential-gate/age` — OpenID4VP/mdoc, phone *(mounted by the SDK)* | `/verify` **+ every completion path → 403** (`passkey/routes.ts:67`, `dc-payment/routes.ts:58`, `app.ts:71`) |
| **membership** (optional) | ✅ in `requires` | `/credential-gate/loyalty` | discount reconciled in pricing (`mandate.ts` Gate 1) |
| **payment** (required) | ✅ in `requires` | `/payment-gate/passkey` or `/dc-payment` (WebAuthn / wallet-signed AP2 over caBLE) | 4 mandate gates + settlement gates completion (`completion.ts`) |

Age is enforced at **three layers** (reported in Ctx 1, proven + checked at `/verify`, re-checked at every
completion path) — exactly CLAUDE.md invariant #1.

## §3 · What the SDK owns vs. what stays yours

- **The SDK (`attesto`) owns:** the per-order verification store; the `/credential-gate/*` ceremony routes
  (via `attesto.mount(app)`); computing the `requires` manifest from a policy; deriving the per-order
  approve link from `walletOrigin + order.id`.
- **You own:** your catalog / pricing (`priceCart` → order with a stable id); your checkout page; your
  payment ceremony + completion (`orderStore`). *(v0.1 — the roadmap pulls payment into the SDK.)*

## §4 · The API (fitted to Context 1)

```ts
import { Attesto, age, membership, payment, required, optional } from "@openmobilehub/attesto-gate";
import { z } from "zod";

const attesto = new Attesto({ walletOrigin: "https://shop.example" });
attesto.mount(app);   // Context 2: mounts /credential-gate/* + owns the per-order verification store

server.registerTool(
  "checkout",
  {
    description: "Check out the cart",
    inputSchema: { items: z.array(z.object({ productId: z.string(), quantity: z.number().int().positive() })) },
  },
  // Context 1 — runs once, when the user clicks Checkout (or says "check out").
  async ({ items }) => {
    const order = priceCart(items);                       // your catalog → order (stable id)
    const requires = attesto.requirements(order, [        // what Context 2 will ask for (for the agent to relay)
      required(age.over(21)),                             // required · enforced at the page + completion
      optional(membership.discount(10)),                  // optional · applied only if presented
      required(payment.in("usd")),                        // required · amount derived from the order
    ]);
    return {
      structuredContent: { orderId: order.id, checkoutUrl: yourCheckoutPage(order), requires },
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Checkout ready — verify age 21+ and pay on your phone: ${yourCheckoutPage(order)}` }],
    };
  },
);
```

Why this reads cleanly (the MCP idiom): the `inputSchema` is shown inline, so `{ items }` traces to it;
`order` comes from your `priceCart(items)`; `requires` comes from the visible `attesto.requirements(...)`
call. Nothing is injected off-screen.

**The policy** (one ordered array — the single source of truth):
- **order** = array position (top-to-bottom = run order; payment always settles last).
- **required / optional** = the explicit wrappers.
- **per-credential options** inline on typed builders — `age.over(21)`, `membership.discount(10)`,
  `payment.in("usd")`. An age gate that sets a currency is a compile error. Payment amount is **derived**
  from the order, never a field you pass (keeps amount-binding in agreement — invariant #3).

## §5 · Two modes [NEEDS DECISION — default = consolidated]

- **Mode A — Consolidated checkout (default).** Context 1 returns the link + `requires`; Context 2 runs
  every gate in one session. Used when the tool hands off to a page (checkout). `attesto.requirements()`.
- **Mode B — Blocking tool.** Context 1 returns a typed `verification_required` envelope and the tool does
  not succeed until the credential clears. For consequential tools with **no** page to hand off to (e.g.
  `transfer_funds`). `attesto.check(order, policy) → { ok, envelope }` (discriminated; the agent branches
  on `!ok` and is type-forced to handle it).

## §6 · Honesty (in the types, not prose)

Two orthogonal typed axes, surfaced (never silent):
- `enforcedAt: "tool" | "checkout"` — *where* a credential runs. v0.1: age = effectively "checkout" via
  the mounted ceremony + completion; membership/payment = "checkout". At GA they flip with no call-site change.
- `trust_level: "presence-only-demo" | "issuer-verified"` — *how much* the mdoc is trusted. v0.1 is
  presence-only (disclosure + nonce binding, **not** issuer/device signatures — `verify.ts`). Fenced as a
  demo, never sold as a safety control, until Multipaz / `@auth0/mdl` integration lands.

## §7 · Security invariants the SDK must preserve (from CLAUDE.md)

1. Enforce gates server-side on **every** completion path (not just the rendered page).
2. Never trust the order token — re-derive amounts from the catalog. (`resolveOrder`/`priceCart` re-prices.)
3. Discounts reconcile with amount binding across all payment paths.
4. Scope verification state per order id — never process-global.
5. Require explicit positive claims (`age_over_21 === true`, not token-presence; 18+ ≠ 21+).
6. Bind OpenID4VP to this origin with nonce/replay protection.

## §8 · Open decisions (for `/speckit.clarify`)

- [ ] **Method names:** `requirements()` (Mode A) / `check()` (Mode B); credential builders `age.over(21)`.
- [ ] **Package name:** `@openmobilehub/attesto-gate` (keep) vs `@openmobilehub/attesto` (one noun).
- [ ] **Single wallet interaction:** can age + payment be one OpenID4VP request (one phone tap), or stay
      sequential on the page as the demo does today?
- [ ] **Default mode confirmed** = consolidated (Mode A) for checkout.
- [ ] `required` / `optional` replace `requireCredential` / `optionalCredential` (keep old as aliases?).
